# FSCVtools

This folder contains tools for making and processing FSCV color plots.
The working language is MATLAB (2019b).  You need to install it with Singal Processing and Machine Learning toolboxes.

I suggest you to download the whole folder, otherwise some file might be left out and the code will not run.

Please contact Max Puthongkham, pp6wr@virginia.edu, for questions and/or suggestions.

1) colorPlorFSCV.m : to make a figure from .hdcv Color .txt file
2) deDrift.m : to detrend the background drift by the Butterworth filter
